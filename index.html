            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>GoFire is Colorado’s newest startup in the medical cannabis space and was looking for both a complete overhaul of their identity and an intuitive iOS app design that integrated with core product. The challenge with this brand was both overcoming my complete unfamiliarity with the space and balancing a medical ethos with a friendly and trusting personality.</p>

        <h2>Logo and Brand Redesign</h2>
        <p><br>It’s unsurprising that the logo GoFire had for their product was hexagonal and sharp, as the hexagon was (and still is) a pretty popular reference to the “new recreational science” of the cannabis industry. <br> 
      </div>

        <p>GoFire was looking to step away from their cool recreational persona and towards something more friendly, medical, and professional that could be conveyed across their consumer, business, and research products. Along with the general rebrand, GoFire was weighing the idea of changing their name to Genii, so there are a handful of renditions of Genii in the mix of logo drafts I have below.

     <p>I chose the soft logotype for it’s cleanliness and friendliness. I also chose the three diamonds as an accent on the upper right to symbolize the vaporizing product that the company produces, and counter-balance the descender of the lowercase g. Finally, I used a soft color palette of turquoise/green, blue, and purple for the brand to differentiate it from stereotypical companies in the cannabis industry that use fairly extreme hues of green.</p>

        <h2>Website</h2>
        <p><br>I worked with GoFire’s CMO over the course of a couple days to design and build a totally revamped website to showcase the new logo and brand for the rest of the company. The three examples I rendered were the homepage, a page for caregivers, and a “science” page that demystified the world of cannabis. The illustrations for these pages were particularly a challenge given my complete ignorance to the industry. Apparently there are two essential components of cannabis called “cannabinoids” and “terpenes” that work with someone’s body chemistry to determine how they will feel when they dose with a particular strand. It was definitely a challenge to come up with arbitrary symbols that would translate well to both someone who didn’t know anything about cannabis and someone who knew exactly what all of this was about.<br></p>

        <p>The purple and turquoise colors would eventually represent opposites across the brand, from purple being terpenes or cancel/negative, to turquoise being cannabinoids or accept/positive. Across the illustrations, font-selection, copy, colors, and logo, I’m very happy with the resulting brand, and the GoFire team was enthusiastic about applying the new brand to their mobile app.</p>

        <h2>iOS App</h2>
        <h3>Primary Dosing Screen</h3>
        <p>GoFire’s primary product interfaces with an iOS device. The device itself is pretty robust, and handles a large array of information for the user. The iOS app would act as the interface, displaying temperature, strand, cannabinoid and terpene profile, device battery life, dosage remaining, and other important stats for the user. This, with the original designs (which resembled a pretty dated period of iOS UI design), made it clear that there’d have to be a lot of information displayed on this screen, so I started this design by exploring how I could consolidate the available information.</p>
      </div>
        <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14104075/20645943/769e3084-b42b-11e6-96f5-a24d4fadfdf2.png">
        <div class="commentary">
          <p>Unfortunately, at the time of writing this case study, I don’t have access to my initial sketches, but I do have a couple of high-quality mockups I made of early iterations:</p>
      </div>
        <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14104075/20645940/769cdbbc-b42b-11e6-9a28-5eee9d17414a.png">
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>This first iteration used a card-system to represent the unique cartridges and strands you could use. THC vs CBD content is a vital relationship that defines how someone will react to a given strand, so I put the two stats front-and-center below the title of the strand. I put the battery life of the product and how much substance was left at the top given that those were the two stats I assumed would fluctuate pretty quickly during a typical use period. I made the top-to-bottom hierarchy from least-controllable to most-controllable, with the most active temperature control at the base of the screen. 
        <br><br>There were a couple of issues with this iteration. First, the ratio of THC to CBD was not well articulated from the base mg count. When a user would load a substance, there wasn’t a good visual indicator as to how substance is different from the old one. Second, the temperature control didn’t indicate any point of progress for the product's preparation of the substance and didn’t offer feedback to the user on their temperature selection. Finally, GoFire wanted to incorporate “reasons for dosing” to collect data on how or why the user is dosing at that time.<br><br>With all of that feedback, I went back to the drawing board and came up with these:</p>
      </div>
      <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14104075/20645941/769d08d0-b42b-11e6-8119-255421681e3c.png">
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>Let’s start from the top. I put the product battery life into an icon, the strand name into the title, and an info label-button in the nav bar to relieve a large amount of real estate in the center of the screen for the primary dial. Tag-buttons above the dial are an easy way for a user to select their reasons for dosing or medicating, providing the necessary data capture that GoFire is looking for. The primary dial displays a visual indicator of the THC and CBD ratio for this particular strand. In the center of the dial is the current temperature, dosage size, and number of dosing sessions left with a particular substance. At the base of the dial is a temperature indicator that bubbles-up from the temperature selector, and then reveals a gradient dosing indicator ring around the primary dial. The glowing diamond at the top of the dial indicates the rate that the user is inhaling through the product and transitions from turquoise in the center to purple at the base when a user isn’t inhaling optimally.
        <br><br>GoFire was really excited about these designs, but still had a couple of fine points of detail to correct. Having the percentage of THC and CBD in a strand didn’t help the user discern much about the profile of the strand they had, so I changed the percentages to labels in the lower corners of the dial. The temperature selector didn’t articulate the degree incrementation of the device, and GoFire wanted to have a warning for when the temperature would cause the cannabis to combust. I tried a couple of temperature selector styles and decided to go with large numbers and five-degree increments to keep things relatively clean.

      <div class="commentary">
        <h3>Tags</h3>
        <p>Along the lines of simplicity, GoFire was concerned that having too many tags above the dial would make it too busy for a user to select their reasons for dosing, so I consolidated the tags to a few with an easily-accessible edit option for selecting more tags. This ended up working out well because if a user were to select new tags for medicating, they may mis-select or keep previous tags without knowing it considering they would have to scroll through all of the tags every time they dosed to make sure everything was setup correctly. That brings us to the tag-selector page:</p>

      <div class="commentary">
        <p>The colored-border tags indicate primary reasons for dosing that a user selects in their profile and on the onboarding screen. I designed this screen in anticipation of a pretty smooth transition from the dosing screen so the user maintains context of what they’re doing. The list of labels would slide-up from the bottom over the dial.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="commentary">
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>Now you may be wondering, how do we know if the product is effective? Through feedback forms! These forms integrate with the product usage history and present themselves after the effects of dosing should theoretically happen. I used the same design as the old temperature indicator because it was good for large increment feedback. The third feedback card design is for doses that may happen when the product isn’t interfaced to an iPhone, as the device can be used repeatedly with a previous setting.</p>

      <div class="commentary">
        <h3>Strand Information</h3>
        <p>Tapping the “Info” label in the upper right of the usage nav brings the user to the stand information screen. This page gives the full chemical breakdown of the strand for the cannabis enthusiast to gawk over. Colors indicate the respective strain THC and CBD breakdown, and tags display what most people use the specific strain for. The “Find” label in the upper right corner of the nav allows the user to locate dispensaries nearby that have this specific strand in stock.</p>

      <div class="commentary">
        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
        <p>There are a couple of key things that need to happen with onboarding for a product like this. First, Apple requires users of a cannabis-related product to indicate their date of birth before using the app, probably to keep it out of the hands of kids. The introductory flow asks users what type of user they will be, separating them into the right user bucket which would influence the copy in their experience of the app as well as their available reasons for dosing or medicating.</p>
      </div>
      <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14104075/20645947/76b00e94-b42b-11e6-8355-17145c6c65c4.png">   
      <div class="commentary">
        <h3>Support</h3>
        <p>The support section is the primary way for users to get all the information they need to dose well with cannabis. The search functionality is supposed to be extremely robust, allowing users to browse videos, articles, tips, dispensary locations, and other information related to dosing with cannabis. The challenge was to condense it all into an attractive and easily-browsable section of the app that wasn’t overwhelming.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="commentary">
        <h3>Other Screens</h3>
        <p>Of the parent pages in the app, the Dosing and Support tabs were the most unique in this design. The Profile and Science tabs are still undergoing design at the time this case study was written, and will be added soon.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><br>The GoFire brand is one of the largest projects I’ve ever worked on. Given that I had no knowledge of the industry and no upper design management for feedback or support, I am very proud of the work I’ve shared with you above. There is still quite a bit ahead for this company, and I hope to see the brand grow in the coming months. Be sure to check back on this case study as I share more of my work with GoFire.</p>
